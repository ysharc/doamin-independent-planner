### Part 1 - Planning problems
#### READ: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig text:

"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" 3rd edition chapter 10 *or* 2nd edition Chapter 11 on Planning, available [on the AIMA book site](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/2nd-ed/newchap11.pdf) sections: 

- *The Planning Problem*
- *Planning with State-space Search*

#### GIVEN: classical PDDL problems

All problems are in the Air Cargo domain.  They have the same action schema defined, but different initial states and goals.

- Air Cargo Action Schema:
```
Action(Load(c, p, a),
	PRECOND: At(c, a) ∧ At(p, a) ∧ Cargo(c) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(a)
	EFFECT: ¬ At(c, a) ∧ In(c, p))	
Action(Unload(c, p, a),
	PRECOND: In(c, p) ∧ At(p, a) ∧ Cargo(c) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(a)
	EFFECT: At(c, a) ∧ ¬ In(c, p))
Action(Fly(p, from, to),
	PRECOND: At(p, from) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(from) ∧ Airport(to)
	EFFECT: ¬ At(p, from) ∧ At(p, to))
```

- Problem 1 initial state and goal:
```
Init(At(C1, SFO) ∧ At(C2, JFK) 
	∧ At(P1, SFO) ∧ At(P2, JFK) 
	∧ Cargo(C1) ∧ Cargo(C2) 
	∧ Plane(P1) ∧ Plane(P2)
	∧ Airport(JFK) ∧ Airport(SFO))
Goal(At(C1, JFK) ∧ At(C2, SFO))
```
- Problem 2 initial state and goal:
```
Init(At(C1, SFO) ∧ At(C2, JFK) ∧ At(C3, ATL) 
	∧ At(P1, SFO) ∧ At(P2, JFK) ∧ At(P3, ATL) 
	∧ Cargo(C1) ∧ Cargo(C2) ∧ Cargo(C3)
	∧ Plane(P1) ∧ Plane(P2) ∧ Plane(P3)
	∧ Airport(JFK) ∧ Airport(SFO) ∧ Airport(ATL))
Goal(At(C1, JFK) ∧ At(C2, SFO) ∧ At(C3, SFO))
```
- Problem 3 initial state and goal:
```
Init(At(C1, SFO) ∧ At(C2, JFK) ∧ At(C3, ATL) ∧ At(C4, ORD) 
	∧ At(P1, SFO) ∧ At(P2, JFK) 
	∧ Cargo(C1) ∧ Cargo(C2) ∧ Cargo(C3) ∧ Cargo(C4)
	∧ Plane(P1) ∧ Plane(P2)
	∧ Airport(JFK) ∧ Airport(SFO) ∧ Airport(ATL) ∧ Airport(ORD))
Goal(At(C1, JFK) ∧ At(C3, JFK) ∧ At(C2, SFO) ∧ At(C4, SFO))
```

>#### Why are we setting the problems up this way?  
>Progression planning problems can be 
solved with graph searches such as breadth-first, depth-first, and A*, where the 
nodes of the graph are "states" and edges are "actions".  A "state" is the logical 
conjunction of all boolean ground "fluents", or state variables, that are possible 
for the problem using Propositional Logic. For example, we might have a problem to 
plan the transport of one cargo, C1, on a
single available plane, P1, from one airport to another, SFO to JFK.
![state space](images/statespace.png)
In this simple example, there are five fluents, or state variables, which means our state 
space could be as large as ![2to5](images/twotofive.png). Note the following:
>- While the initial state defines every fluent explicitly, in this case mapped to **TTFFF**, the goal may 
be a set of states.  Any state that is `True` for the fluent `At(C1,JFK)` meets the goal.
>- Even though PDDL uses variable to describe actions as "action schema", these problems
are not solved with First Order Logic.  They are solved with Propositional logic and must
therefore be defined with concrete (non-variable) actions
and literal (non-variable) fluents in state descriptions.
>- The fluents here are mapped to a simple string representing the boolean value of each fluent
in the system, e.g. **TTFFTT...TTF**.  This will be the state representation in 
the `AirCargoProblem` class and is compatible with the `Node` and `Problem` 
classes, and the search methods in the AIMA library.

### Part 2 - Domain-independent heuristics
#### READ: Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig text
"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" 3rd edition chapter 10 *or* 2nd edition Chapter 11 on Planning, available [on the AIMA book site](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/2nd-ed/newchap11.pdf) section: 

- *Planning Graph*

>#### Why a Planning Graph?
>The planning graph is somewhat complex, but is useful in planning because it is a polynomial-size approximation of the exponential tree that represents all possible paths. The planning graph can be used to provide automated admissible heuristics for any domain.  It can also be used as the first step in implementing GRAPHPLAN, a direct planning algorithm that you may wish to learn more about on your own (but we will not address it here).

## Examples and Testing:
Use Python 3.4 or higher for the following instructions

- To solve the "Have Cake and Eat it Too" problem in the book run
```
python example_have_cake.py
```

- To select and solve an air cargo problem with a your choice of the algorithm run the interactive script
```
python run_search.py -m
```
